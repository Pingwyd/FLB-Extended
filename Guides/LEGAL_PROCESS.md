# Legal Team Process for Contracts and Litigation

## 1. Contract Generation & Review
- **Automated Contracts:** The Platform generates standard contracts for land leases and worker hiring based on templates approved by the Legal Team.
- **Custom Clauses:** Any custom clauses added by users must be flagged for manual review by a Legal Officer before the contract is finalized.
- **Dispute Clauses:** All contracts must include the standard arbitration clause (Section 7 of ToS).

## 2. Contract Breach & Enforcement
- **Reporting:** Users report breaches via the "Report" feature on the specific contract.
- **Investigation:**
    1. Admin/Moderator reviews the report and evidence (chat logs, transaction history).
    2. If the breach is clear (e.g., non-payment), the Admin can enforce penalties (wallet deduction, account suspension).
    3. If the breach is complex, it is escalated to the Legal Team.
- **Escalation:** The Legal Team reviews complex cases within 5 business days and issues a binding decision.

## 3. Litigation Protocol
- **Pre-Litigation:** We aim to resolve all disputes through mediation and arbitration first.
- **External Counsel:** If a user initiates a lawsuit against the Platform, the Legal Team will engage external counsel immediately.
- **Data Preservation:** Upon notice of litigation, all relevant user data (logs, messages, transactions) is placed on "Legal Hold" and cannot be deleted.

## 4. Regulatory Compliance
- **Data Privacy:** The Legal Team conducts quarterly audits to ensure compliance with NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) and other relevant laws.
- **Financial Regulations:** We work with our payment partners to ensure compliance with CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulations regarding digital wallets and transactions.

## 5. Updates to Legal Documents
- The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are reviewed annually.
- Any changes must be communicated to users via email at least 30 days before taking effect.
